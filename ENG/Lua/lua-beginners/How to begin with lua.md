Hello, dear Lua enthusiast, I'm Ludaro,

I assume you want to learn Lua for FiveM since that's the main reason for this wiki. I'd like to give you some simple tips.

Lua is a relatively simple language that is well-suited for beginners, but Lua isn't the only language included in FiveM; you can also program in C# and JavaScript, both of which are more complex.

However, what's important isn't which language you use and how you use it, but whether you genuinely want to learn Lua and have the time for it.

Here's a small checklist of what I think you need to effectively learn Lua:

- [ ] Learn Lua at your own pace and in your own style. Don't let anyone tell you how your code should be (but still accept criticism and use it to improve). Learn the way you want, not just the way others dictate. Work at your own speed and in your own way because you want to learn how you can, not how others did.

- [ ] Learn Lua with a lasting purpose (Gmod, small robots, IRL, FiveM, etc.).

- [ ] Challenge yourself! Do something new, not the same thing that's been done 400 times before.

- [ ] Learn English if possible (English is very important because it's the primary language used in almost all programming languages).

I find all of these points important to truly learn Lua and understand it.

Of course, this wiki will also help you a lot with that! <3 Just read through everything and get inspired. Ideally, find a small project that's designed for you to learn from.

# What Programs You Need to Program with Lua:

- A text editor (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) that makes Lua understandable (Visual Studio Code does this through extensions).

- A decent FiveM server (or host a FiveM server on your own PC using XAMPP).

If you prefer to learn Lua with a tutor by your side, you can reach out to me on Discord or use the Lua Scripting Playlist by myscripts! In this playlist, the creator of myscripts delves into the basics of Lua and FiveM, and it's highly recommended!
