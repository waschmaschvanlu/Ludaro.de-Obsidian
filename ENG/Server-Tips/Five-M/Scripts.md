# What are Scripts?

Scripts are essentially "mods" that can be installed in FiveM and can add various functions, such as a multi-character system.

# Where is the best place to get Scripts?

In the cfx.re forum, there is a subcategory called "Releases" where all new scripts are posted. You should check there. ðŸ˜Š [Here is the link](https://forum.cfx.re/c/development/releases/7)

# What should I look out for?

- Make sure the seller hasn't leaked the script ([[What is leaking]])
- Check if the seller provides support for their script and doesn't ignore you after you've purchased it.
- Always read the comments before purchasing scripts and form an opinion about the seller.
- Ideally, the seller should offer a Tebex shop. Anything without Tebex is often untrustworthy and can lead to problems. Most Tebex sellers are trustworthy, and if you encounter issues, you can contact the Tebex shop. Otherwise, you can only contact the seller who may ignore you.
