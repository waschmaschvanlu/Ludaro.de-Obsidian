**Leaking** or "Leaking" refers to the act of unauthorized distribution of resources (in our case, FiveM scripts) that have been purchased.

**Example:**
Suppose you buy a script from me, like an entry script, and then you give it to your friend. In this case, you've "leaked" the script to your friend, and your friend is using a leaked version.

# Information About Leaks
Leaks are not as common today because there is a system called [Keymaster](http://keymaster.fivem.net) that prevents unauthorized distribution of scripts. However, in the past, this was not the case, and many leaked scripts originate from those times when no support is available.

Some scripts may also contain a so-called "backdoor," which is a kind of loophole that allows the person who gave you the script to gain access to your server once you start it.

It's important to emphasize that leaking is strictly prohibited in the FiveM community and should not be practiced.
