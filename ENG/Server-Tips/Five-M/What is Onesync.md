# What is OneSync in FiveM?

OneSync is an important server setting in FiveM that enhances player and entity synchronization on a server. This feature does not increase the number of players on a server but optimizes the player experience and server performance. OneSync is particularly crucial for servers with a high player count, typically starting from 50 players or more.

## Costs and Availability

Here's the good news: OneSync is entirely free for smaller servers with fewer than 10 slots. This means if you're running a small server with a few friends, you can use OneSync without any additional costs.

However, for larger servers with more than 10 slots, there are fees involved. You can enable OneSync on the cfx Patreon (Link: [https://www.patreon.com/fivem](https://www.patreon.com/fivem)) by donating at least â‚¬15 per month. With OneSync, servers can support more than 10 slots and provide an even more immersive player experience.

## Why Use OneSync?

OneSync is particularly essential for servers that accommodate many players simultaneously. It enhances player and entity synchronization, leading to a smoother and more stable player experience.

One notable feature of OneSync is its ability to stream custom clothing and textures, which is not typically possible. This allows server admins to create and use unique outfits and textures on their servers.

Whether you should use OneSync or not depends on the size of your server. It's free for smaller servers with fewer than 10 slots. For larger servers with more than 10 slots, especially starting from 50 or more players, OneSync is often necessary to ensure performance and synchronization.

That's essentially what OneSync in FiveM is all about. It improves synchronization and enables the streaming of custom clothing and textures. However, do consider the costs if you want more than 10 slots on your server.
