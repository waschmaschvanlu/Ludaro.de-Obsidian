When hosting a Five-M Server there are several thing to lookout for, 
- What  Type of Performance you need
- What Type of a Server you want to use
- What are your experiences with Hosting a Server

 and this page will go over:
 - What are Server-Types?
 - What type of Performance would i need?
 - Linux or Windows?

# What are Server-Types
in Hosting there are multiple Server-Types these are
- Root-Server, 
- V-Server (Virtual-Server) , 
- Pre-Installed server 
- Dedicated Server 
im gonna explain what all of these are

## Root-Server
Root-Server are Servers that are to 100% yours, the whole server sitting in a Computer Centre is yours.  this is the best for Performance and Openness.

## V-Server
V-Server or Virtual Servers are Servers that are Virtually Split up,
so one server is split up to 4 Servers through a software and you get one of them

these Servers are cheaper then Root-Servers but lack some of the Powers that  Root-Server provide. V-Servers are a good option if you just want a Cheap Server


## Pre-Installed Server
Some Server-Providers give you a Service where you get a Virtual or Rootserver where the game you wanna play (in our case FiveM) is installed, these are most of the times in Linux, which is a very hard operating system to learn.more on that later

You still have a Fully Open Linux server to your arms, so its not like a Dedicated Server 


# Dedicated Server

A Dedicated Server is a Server where it is only made for one thing (in our case fivem) and you only get that service. nothing else you cant do anything else then what the Server Provider allows you to do these are mostly cheaper but you have almost no freedom outside of the settings the game gives you. (Zap-Hosting for an Example does this)


# Linux or Windows?

This is a very hard question which is very depenent on what type of server you want to create, and what experience you have and or want to get with Server-Building,

- Windows is better for People who never had to do anything with Servers but is a little bit more unperformant because it has to run a whole operating system (fivem is made for windows, but most programms are not)


- Linux is better if you wanna start learning Servers and want to go into hosting other stuff aswell. but it has a very hard learning curve and needs a lot of time to experiment with, and alot of patience to get right!
