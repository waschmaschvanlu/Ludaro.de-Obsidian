# Where Does This Error Come From?

This error occurs when a player attempts to execute a function without proper validation to check if the player has been fully loaded.

# How Do I Fix This Error?

Typically, this error occurs either because a player is not fully loaded yet (e.g., ESX hasn't started, or the player is still in the character selection menu) or because a script is not properly configured.

To fix this error, you should ensure that:

1. ESX or the relevant framework has been properly started before the script is executed. This may involve making sure that ESX is fully initialized before attempting to access ESX-specific functions.

2. You verify that the player is in the game and fully loaded before calling functions that require player actions. This can often be checked by ensuring that the player is already moving in the game and is no longer in the character selection menu.

3. You confirm that the script is properly configured and called in the correct order. This may involve ensuring that dependencies are loaded before the script is executed and that the necessary resources are available.

By following these steps and ensuring that your script correctly responds to player status and the game environment, you can resolve this error in most cases.
