# I Have a Folder Named "essentialmode" in My Resources

If this is the case, and you don't have a folder named "es_extended" in your resources, you are likely using the ESX version referred to as "1.1," also known as "essentialmode." This version is over 6 years old and has security vulnerabilities and issues. Many scripts may not work with this version anymore.

EssentialMode has various exploits, including the dangerous **SQL injection**, which can grant a player full access to the database (as a regular player).

Some claim that "EssentialMode" is better because it runs smoother. This is because at that time, FiveM was less complex, and many more complex features were added in es_extended (the newer versions). This caused many scripts not to rely on EssentialMode anymore but on individual scripts, potentially making scripts less efficient but the framework (ESX) more modern and better-looking.

If you want to upgrade to a newer version, you can find instructions in [[How to Update ESX]].

# I Have Folders Named "Essentialmode" and "es_extended" in My Resources

If this is the case, you are using a rare version called "extendedmode." In this case, the above information about EssentialMode still applies.

# I Have a Folder Named "es_extended" in My Resources

You are using an ESX version that is higher than 1.2 (1.1 = Essentialmode, anything above 1.2 = es_extended).

You can check the exact ESX version you are using by looking in the fxmanifest file of es_extended. The version number is specified there.

All versions newer than 1.2 are also referred to as "ESX Legacy." The latest version at the time of writing this article is ESX 1.10.1.

To learn more about ESX versions, please read the [ESX Wiki](https://documentation.esx-framework.org/legacy/installation/).
