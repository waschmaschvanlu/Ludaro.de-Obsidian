In the world of hosting, various aspects play a crucial role:

- Required performance
- Type of server (VPS or dedicated server)
- Your experience in server hosting

This guide is intended for you, whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, to avoid hosting issues.

In my opinion, there are three main hosting variations, but before we proceed, let's clarify some terminology:

## Types of Servers

### Dedicated Server
A dedicated server is a server located in a data center that belongs entirely to you.

### VPS (Virtual Private Server)
A VPS is a virtual server where you own a portion of a larger server. This comes with some performance and freedom trade-offs but is typically more cost-effective. However, these trade-offs are not generally relevant for a FiveM server.

## Types of Operating Systems

There are two main operating systems for server hosting: Linux and Windows.

Both are good options but have their respective advantages and disadvantages in various aspects.

For instance, Linux tends to run faster and more efficiently but requires more technical knowledge and effort during setup.

On the other hand, Windows may be slightly slower but offers the convenience of managing the server similar to a Windows PC through Remote Desktop Connection.

In the [[Windows VS Linux]] section, this comparison is further explored, discussing which option might be better in the end.

## Dedicated Server Providers

Dedicated server providers like Zap-Hosting do not offer you a complete server where you can do anything you want. Instead, you receive a FiveM server only. This is simpler because you don't have to deal with managing an entire server. However, it has the disadvantage of being tied to a specific provider, and you may have limited control over the server's configuration.
